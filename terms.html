1 ACCEPTANCE
By installing or using the extension you confirm that you are at least 18 years old and have read, understood and agree to these terms and to our privacy policy. If you do not agree, do not use the extension.

2 SERVICE
The extension modifies how LinkedIn job search pages are displayed in your browser (filtering jobs, highlighting words, etc.). LinkedIn does not sponsor, endorse or operate this extension.

3 TRIAL AND PURCHASES
‚Ä¢ Free trial: You may start one free trial. Trial length is shown in the ExtGate customer portal. Access ends automatically when the trial expires unless you buy a plan. If you are not satisfied with the extension, please do not purchase access.
‚Ä¢ Plans: We offer either a one-time license valid for the current major version, or a subscription billed in advance. Subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled from your ExtGate/Stripe customer portal. If we reprice a subscription, you will be notified in advance.
‚Ä¢ Payments: All payments are processed by Stripe.
‚Ä¢ Refunds: All sales are final; we do not provide refunds, except where required by law.

4 SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS
We will exercise reasonable skill and care to keep the extension working. However:
‚Ä¢ LinkedIn may block, modify or remove the page elements the extension depends on.
‚Ä¢ Browser updates may affect operation.

If functionality stops or degrades for these reasons, we will attempt to restore it but make no guarantee of success, timeliness or continued availability, and no refund or compensation is owed.

‚Ä¢ Use the extension in a way that violates LinkedIn‚Äôs terms of service or applicable law.
‚Ä¢ Introduce malware or interfere with service-providing servers.
‚Ä¢ Attempt to bypass ExtGate access management checks.

We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the extension for personal, non-commercial purposes in a compatible browser. You may not copy, sell, reverse-engineer, or make derivative works of the extension.

7 WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
The extension is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù. To the maximum extent permitted by law we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

8 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the fullest extent permitted by law we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages, or for lost data, profits or opportunities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability to you for direct damages is capped at the amount you paid for the extension.

9 TERMINATION
We may terminate or suspend your license immediately if you breach these terms. You may stop using and uninstall the extension at any time.

10 GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES
These terms are governed by Swiss law. Before starting formal proceedings you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the issue informally. If you are an EU consumer, you may also use the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform.

11 CHANGES
We may revise these terms. If changes are material we will post the new version here and update the effective date. Continued use of the extension after a change takes effect signifies acceptance of the revised terms.
